Sales Engine is a project from Turing School, used to fulfill the following goals:
#################
* Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code with high test coverage
* Build a complex system using multiple interacting classes
* Reuse implementation code via duck typing and modules
* Separate parsing / data loading logic from business logic
* Use memoization and careful variable scoping to improve performance

Abstract
